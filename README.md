## Introduction
This project is for a image semantic segmantation challenge by Lyft & Udacity, the algorithm was benchmarked on a video recorded using [CARLA](http://carla.org/), CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.

This is a postmortem for this project. This article will discuss the 3 following topics:

1. How I setup the architecture for the project,
1. What are the challenges and what's my solution to them,
1. What are the potential improvement for this project.

Now, let's get started!
